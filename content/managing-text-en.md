# Managing the text

Adding images is an important step for most layouts, but, very often, it's about placing illustrations that support the text: it's the work on the text that is the most time consuming, the one that needs to be the most accurate.

Scribus provides many typographical features and advanced tools to support an accurate and as quick as possible workflow.

The more you aim at a refined work, the longer it will take, but the effort will not be vain and the reading comfort will be improved. The perceived quality of your document will also grow.
