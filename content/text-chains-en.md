# Linking text frames

When the text is too long and overflows the frame, Scribus displays a small red square at the bottom right.

If you want the text to continue in another frame, you can create a link between frames:

1. Click on the black arrow tool ![](text-chains/pointer.png).
2. Click on the frame containing the text.
3. Click on the frame link icon ![](text-chains/link-text.png).
4. Create a new text frame.
5. The text flows from one frame to the next.

You can also create a link to an existing frame (on the same page or on the next page) but it is imperative that the second one does not contain any text:

1. Activate the frame containing the text ![](text-chains/pointer.png).
2. Click on the frame link icon ![](text-chains/link.png).
3. Click on the second frame.
5. The text flows from one frame to the next.

To remove the link between frames, use the "unlink" tool ![](text-chains/unlink.png) placed just after the link tool and follow the same procedure, but first click on the second frame, then on the first one.

A little hint: to link the frames, you can also click on the overflow mark, without first activating the link tool.
