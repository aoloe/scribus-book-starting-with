# Preparing the image in Gimp

It is preferable to import the images at their _final_ size.

Here is a step-by-step description of an optimized workflow:

1. In Scribus, create an image frame of the desired size.
2. Make sure that the Properties window (F2) is visible and activate the the XYZ tab.
3. Take note of the the height and width.
4. Start the Gimp and open the image file.
5. Open the  "Image > Scale Image" menu.
7. In the "Scale Image"  dialog, pick the same unit as in Scribus, and type the height or width, depending on which side you want to fit in Scribus. Validate.
8. Export the image, preferably as PNG or TIF type (pick the desired file type in the Export dialog).
9. Close Gimp.
10. In Scribus, import the image into your image frame as described in the previous section.
11. If the frame does not fit, right-click on the frame and choose "Image > Adjust frame to the image".

There you are.

> Off course , you use a different software than Gimp, one with similar features. I am thinking in particular of Krita who is an alternative to Gimp that is getting more and more popular.
