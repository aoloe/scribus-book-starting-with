# Insert text

Text insertion is essential for most publications.  Like other DTP software, Scribus asks you to create a text frame before you can to type any text in the document. The steps are very simple:

1. Activate the text frame tool using the button in the toolbar or the T shortcut.

2. In the page, press the left mouse button and drag while keeping the button pressed. Release it when the shape seems roughly correct.

3. You can adapt the frame size and position by using:

  - The Selection tool.
  - The XYZ tab of the Properties window. The width and height values relate to the size; the X and Y to the horizontal and vertical position in the page.

To write the text, double-click in the frame and type. For the typographic settings, go to the Text tab of the Properties window.

By default, Text frames are rectangular (just like the Image frames). To modify their shape, you can use the Shape settings in the Shape tab of the Properties window.
