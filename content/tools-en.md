# The tools

The _Tools_ let you add things to a page.  
The question is: what do you want to add? Here is the list of the main tools:

![The Scribus Toolbar](tools/toolbar-en.png)

For text, the _Text frame_: tool (shortcut T or ![](tools//tool-text.png))

For images, the _Image frame_ tool (shortcut I or ![](tools//tool-image.png)).

For geometric shapes, _polygon_ tool or the preset _shapes_.

It's worth noting that the frame tools allow you to specify an area where you will write or load a text. When you create the frame, no text or images are inserted.

It's also worth noting that it is impossible to add an image in a text frame or text in an image frame. If you created the wrong type of frame, you can use the _Item > Convert to_ menu and choose the type of frame you intended.

Finally, polygons cannot contain text or images. If you want to place text or an image in one of the geometric shapes, you will first need to convert it as explained above. Polygons are more appropriate for creating decorative shapes or backgrounds.
