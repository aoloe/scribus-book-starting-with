# Write some text

In Scribus, you don't write directly on the page: first you create frames which will then contain the text.

The frames have an exact position and size and are freely placed on the page.

## Draw a frame

Activate the text tool by using the _Insert > Text frame_ menu or the `Insert text frame` icon ![icon](tools/tool-text.png) next to the arrow ![icon](tools/tool-select.png) in the toolbar. Draw the text frame on the page by [clicking and dragging](glossary-en.md#clic-and-drag).

You can resize your frame by click-dragging the small red square at the lower right corner: resize it so that it can contain two lines of text: "Johannes Gutenberg".

## Writing

After you have created your frame, Scribus automatically switches back to Item Selection mode ![icon](tools/tool-select.png) which allows you to select and move items.

Double-click inside the frame to enter the "Edit Contents" mode. The _adjustment_ squares disappear, and you can type in Gutenberg's name.

When you double-click to type into a frame, the handles of the frame disappear.

The text formatting is done in the main tab of the Text Properties window.

## Formatting

But your text is quite small isn't it? To change the size select all the text, activate the main tab of _Window > Text Properties_, and play around with the Font Families ❶, Styles ❷ and Sizes ❸.

> While in  _Edit Contents_ mode, you can use the _Edit > Select All_ menu entry to select all text.

If the lines are slightly overlapping, you can increase the Line Spacing ❹. It is usually 20% larger than the font size, but this is no hard rule, especially for titles.

You can exit the _Edit Contents_ mode by clicking on the canvas outside the frame or by pressing the _Esc_ key.
Of course you can get back in the _Edit Contents_ mode by double-clicking inside the frame.
