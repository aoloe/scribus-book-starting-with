# Checking the document and exporting to PDF

After completing your first project, it's time to export it to a PDF for printing and distribution: the command for it is: _File > Export > Save as PDF_.

## The preview mode

Scribus assists you in your work by showing lines around the frames, guides and page margins.

That's very useful to make sure that the details are correct, but they get in the way when you want to evaluate the overhall appearance.

_View > Preview > Preview Mode_ hides – and shows again – all the visual helps drawn by Scribus. The _ctrl-alt-p_ allows to quick switch the feature on and off.

> Warning: while in preview mode you cannot edit your document.

## The preflight verifier

When you run _File > Export > Save as PDF_, you will probably get the "Preflight verifier" dialog: it warns about issues Scribus found in your document.

It's a good habit to fix all the warnings, but you can press the _Ignore Errors_ button to 

> A hint: clicking on a warning, selects the affected item.

## Exporting to PDf

Scribus' PDF export is one if its most powerful feature. The Export dialog is just as complex.

Luckily, Scribus' defaults will give you a correct PDF, ready to be printed.

There are high chances that the PDF will print correctly on your office or home printer.

On the other hand, Print Shops tend to be more restrictive and you might need to export to a specific PDF version, use a color profile, convert all colors to CMYK, or outline all fonts.
In the last chapter [Saving and exporting](saving-and-exporting.md) you will learn more about those settings.

> You might have noticed that we did not mention _File > Print_: indeed, we recommend to always first create a PDF, check it with a PDF reader and print it from there.
