# The basics

Desktop publishing is a peculiar task. Despite being rather similar to word processing there are a few key differences. When layouting a document, the whole content is an object, even the page. Every object is carefully placed. Every object gets its meaning from its formatting and through the relationships with the other objects.

Creating a layout it's about composing, distributing, spread to better convey the message, and – at the same time – increasing the graphical quality and improving the readability. Some say that the most beautiful layouts are those that get unnoticed.
